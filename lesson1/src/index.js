// Objectives:
// 1. Set up the basic React code from scratch
// 2. Create a functional component called MyInfo that returns the following UI:
    // a. An h1 with your name
    // b. A paragraph with a little blurb about yourself
    // c. An ordered or unordered list of the top 3 vacation spots you'd like to visit
// 3. Render an instance of that functional component to the browser
// Extra challenge: learn on your own (Google!) how you can add some style to your page.
// (We will also cover this in an upcoming lesson).


import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function MyInfo()Â {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name: Matt Plank</h1>
      <p>This is my first ReactJS application, but I'm learning to better prep for my role as a team lead on a ReactJS project.</p>
      <h2>Vacation Spots I'd like to visit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Golf Shores, AL</li>
        <li>Paris, FR</li>
        <li>Sonoma County, CA</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    )
}

ReactDOM.render(MyInfo(), document.getElementById("root"))
